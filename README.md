Tran Binh Minh (Team Leader):

Idea Generation and Conceptual Design: As the team leader, I initiated the project with the foundational idea of designing the use case diagram and the general class diagram. These conceptual designs were vital in setting the direction for our project.
Slide Preparation: I took the responsibility of creating the presentation slides, ensuring that our project's concept and progress were effectively communicated.
Framework Decision: I played a key role in selecting the source code to use as a reference, enabling us to rebuild and enhance it according to our project needs.


Nguyen Huu Minh:

Technical Mentorship and Guidance: Nguyen Huu Minh, with his superior technical skills, played a crucial role in guiding the team members through the coding process. He provided invaluable assistance and mentorship, helping each team member to write their own sections of code.
Code Integration and Optimization: Nguyen Huu Minh was responsible for collecting, optimizing, and merging the work contributed by all team members. This key role explains why he was the primary individual pushing code to our GitHub repository. Their expertise ensured that the final codebase was cohesive, efficient, and reflected the collective effort of the entire team.

Lieu Nhat Minh and Phan Do Hai Minh:

Diagram Creation: They were responsible for transforming my initial designs into formal diagrams using Astah. Their attention to detail in creating the use case and class diagrams was essential for visually representing the structure of our application.
Code Contribution: Both Lieu Nhat Minh and Phan Do Hai Minh actively contributed to the coding process. They provided valuable insights and assisted in refining specific segments of the code, ensuring a well-rounded and thoroughly vetted codebase.

3. Conclusion

The successful completion of our OOP midterm mini project is a testament to the collaborative and balanced nature of our team. Each member played a pivotal role, contributing their unique skills and perspectives. As the team leader, I am proud to highlight not only the individual contributions but also the collective spirit and mutual support that defined our project journey.
